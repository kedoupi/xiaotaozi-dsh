/**
 * Session-cost estimate — prices the host-folded cumulative billed-token
 * totals (SessionCostUsage) with DeepSeek's V4 list prices, HARDCODED for
 * now (per request; revisit when DeepSeek adjusts prices). Source:
 * https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing/ (USD) and
 * https://api-docs.deepseek.com/zh-cn/quick_start/pricing/ (CNY).
 *
 * Peak windows are 01:00-04:00 and 06:00-10:00 UTC (off-peak is half the
 * peak rate); the Host already split the totals by period, so pricing here
 * is a pure lookup. Both currencies the UI ships are tabulated — the locale
 * picks which one the stats board shows.
