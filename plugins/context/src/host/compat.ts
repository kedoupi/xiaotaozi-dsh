/**
 * Session-projection unit contract compatibility layer.
 *
 * The harness's session-projection registry changed its unit contract between
 * dsh 0.1.0-rc.8 and 0.1.1-rc.1:
 *   - dsh <= 0.1.0-rc.8: `{ key, schema, init, apply, view, stateVersion }`
 *     (one `schema` validates the wire payload; `view` is top-level).
 *   - dsh >= 0.1.1-rc.1: `{ key, stateSchema, init, apply, wire?, stateVersion }`
 *     (`stateSchema` validates the PERSISTED fold state; a client-visible
 *     unit carries a `wire` block with `viewSchema` + `view`; a unit WITHOUT
 *     `wire` is host-only — its value is never delivered to clients).
 *
 * A definition that carries BOTH shapes on one object is accepted by every
 * registry: each version reads the fields it knows and ignores the extras.
 * That is what this plugin emits — the same fold state and the same wire
 * view, declared twice under the two contracts.
 *
 * The installed devDependency types still pin the pre-0.1.1 contract, so the
 * current (0.1.1-rc.1+) shape is mirrored here as {@link
 * ProjectionDefinitionV2} to keep both halves compile-checked.
